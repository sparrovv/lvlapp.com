## Story:

There are many ways to improve your english. 
The one that I find the most helpful is to go out and start speak with other people, especially with natives.

Unfortunately this not always an option. The other method that I find very successful is to listen english without any subtitles. 
The listening has to be active, and you should make an effort to understand everything.

To validate that is to put down what you hear, and then compare with existing transcript and see how good was your understanding of heared audio.
Listening and writing is very hard per se, and validating this is very cumbersome.
I created that app to help with that.

Choose an audio from all available, choose the type that you're interested in.

1. Pro - type all
2. Intermediate - type only first letters
3. Intermediate - type only missing words

Gather exp, and compare with others. See how you elevate over time.

Files are split into very categories:

* by level [easy, medium, hard]
* by time [short, …. long]
* by tags [music, news, ….]

          <h3>How does it work</h3>
          <p>
          <strong>LvlApp</strong>'s goal is to help you to level up your English as a second language by listening, writing and repetition.
          </p>
          <p>
          The idea is simple, pick up the video that you're interested in, choose the difficulty, and start playing by filling in blank spaces. There are plenty of keyboard shortcuts that will help you to navigate over the transcript. You can repeat every line as many times you want. There is no time limit, the goal is to learn!

        <h3>Choose the difficulty</h3>
        <p>
        The video will load and you will be able to select one of the few difficulty levels. All levels are based on the amount of words that you would have to fill in, and for example medium level has one missing word per line on average.
